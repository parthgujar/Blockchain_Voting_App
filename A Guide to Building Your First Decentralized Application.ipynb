    "\n",
    "Decentralized systems are ones where no node is telling any other node what to do.  Bitcoin is both distributed because its timestamped public ledger, the blockchain, resides on multiple computer and decentralized because if one node goes down, the network is still able to operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple Servers\n",
    "- Demand and Failures better handled \n",

    "If we delve into the traditional business models, all of them require the product or service for sale to be better than that of the competitor. Open sourcing your product would mean that any competitor could take all of your work, white label it, and sell it as their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having the app be open source allowed the network the transparency it needed to improve itself with developer contributions and grow trust amongst its users to give its coins real world value. Open sourcing your dapp will gain the trust of potential users. Anyone can fork your dapp, but they can’t fork your development team. Users want to get behind the people best suited to maintain the dapp, and those tend to be the original developers.\n",
